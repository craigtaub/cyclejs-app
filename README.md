## Common problem-solving pattern for Cycle.js
"formulate the computerâ€™s behavior as a function of streams: continuously listen to source messages from drivers and continuously provide sinks messages (e.g. Virtual DOM elements) to the drivers."

## Setup cycle.js boilerplate
https://github.com/edge/cyc, dev + production ready.
babel, hot reloading, isomorphic server.
https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/tree/master/examples

## Architecture
Message passing HCI (human/computer interaction)
two-way process, computer + human. Both listen + speak.


## GOOD
Guide seems smooth and walks you through each point.
Hello World works.
Split into MANY seperate packages, DOM/HTTP/rxjs/xstream/jsonp
Holistic approach, can do many things.

## BAD
relies on external lib xstream and rxjs stuff.
