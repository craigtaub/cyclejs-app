# Cycle.js app


## Instructions
- Install Babel via Browserify, no CLI or Require hook.
- https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/#installation



## Setup cycle.js boilerplate
- https://github.com/edge/cyc, dev + production ready.
- babel, hot reloading, isomorphic server.
- https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/tree/master/examples


## GOOD
- Guide seems smooth and walks you through each point.
- Hello World works.
- Split into MANY seperate packages, DOM/HTTP/rxjs/xstream/jsonp
- Holistic approach, can do many things.

## BAD
- relies on external lib xstream (custom built for Cycle.js tho) and rxjs stuff.
